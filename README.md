# Sales Analysis

## Introduction 

This repository contains a simulated retail dataset titled “Sales Case Study.csv”, designed to support exploratory data analysis, modelling, and demonstration of analytical workflows. The dataset represents daily aggregated trading information for a single product sold in a large retail store. Although simulated, it follows the structure and behaviour of real-world retail data, making it suitable for learning, experimentation, and reproducible examples.

Each record in the dataset includes:

Date – The day on which sales activity occurred

Sales – The total Rand value of revenue generated

Cost of Sales – The Rand value of the direct costs associated with those sales

Quantity Sold – The number of units sold that day

These fields provide a practical foundation for performing time-series analysis, profitability assessments, forecasting, and general data exploration. The dataset can be used to illustrate data cleaning, feature engineering, visualisation techniques, as well as basic financial and statistical modelling within a retail context.

## Insights
